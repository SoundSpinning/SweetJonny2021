              <li><em>Objectives</em>: to form a collaborative production process between the engineer and the band, so that progress is made via constructive feedback.</li>
              <li>All tracks have been loudness normalised to a similar level as currently used by Spotify &amp; YouTube to set a fair comparison. This is a fairly recent change in music streamming, which may be the beginning of the end of the <em>Loudness War</em>.</li>
              <li>The above means that you can open those apps in parallel, set their volume to max and compare (roughly) to the mixes. Use the main master control in your system to turn the music up / down.</li>
              <li>This player allows for switching across tracks by clicking the play button. E.g. you can switch back / forth between tabs to compare versions of the same song.</li>
              <li>When sending <em>Feedback</em> via the form, pls state the system you used for listening: phone, tablet, headphones, large speakers, car, etc; so that I can get some context. Have fun !</li>

              You know that living it up in the Hill's a <br>
              bit like pissing the bed it's warm at first <br>
              but you've got to clean it up.<br>
              Get hooked on fags and bags and booze, <br>
              you're going nowhere fast, <br>
              the future's past you can't lose.<br>
              (Chorus)<br>
              <br>
              Is Stockholm syndrom taking hold,<br>
              Has Gary Burgess grown old.<br>
              Still bullying blowjobs down by the cemetery.<br>
              And will you take it on the chin,<br>
              And what will end my suffering.<br>
              <br>
              I hear the farewell fanfares rise and falling again.<br>
              Pay The Piper pick your poison. <br>
              All the fun now at the fair has grown old.<br>
              All that glitters is not gold, <br>
              The truth be told we've been told that you're getting too old.<br>
              (Guitar break riff)<br>
              <br>
              So now you've gone and got emotional <br>
              on a Sunday morning are the adverts all making you cry.<br>
              Because you've taken too much the night before, <br>
              the only lover in your covers is your hand and you're getting too sore.<br>
              (Chorus | Solo)<br>
              <br>
              So now the eulogy is mine to read.<br>
              Stomped to death in sweat filled beds you shall be.<br>
              Thank god euphoria has sucked me dry, <br>
              kiss the girls and make them cry you're all done.<br>

              I was born on the back seat of a banger.<br>
              I love the smell of petrol, diesel and two stroke.<br>
              You see in my blood stream,<br>
              I got a genuine oil seam.<br>
              I never wanted to be anything other.<br>
              So strip away the glass, seats and the trim.<br>
              Yeah my day job it can do one,<br>
              You tell my boss I said do one.<br>
              (Pre chorus)<br>
              <br>
              I'll have no regrets, my carbourators ait bled.<br>
              A roll cage is all that I will require.<br>
              My exhaust sets fire.<br>
              A burn out and a bunch of bald tires.<br>
              (Chorus)<br>
              <br>
              Cos I was born to be a banger racer. (x 3)<br>
              <br>
              So with motor oil I'll slick back my hair.<br>
              And with a rollie on my lips fill her up,<br>
              As she's running on Red Star:<br>
              I siphoned it off a farmer.<br>
              And with the welder I will spark up my fag.<br>
              My lungs exhaust fumes, dirt and dust.<br>
              It fills my head I feel clear.<br>
              My knuckles slam her in gear.<br>

              <br>
              (Bridge)<br>
              So you tell my father and you tell my daughter's and you tell my wife where I have gone.<br>
              And you'll know where to find me on the speedway start line with my shell suit and my helmet donned.<br>
              <br>
              I was born on the back seat of a banger.<br>

              My role is unfulfilling, and my last control is violence. <br>
              The love between my wife and me, has long since died, departed. <br>

              It was cold I remember that much, and under the church is where I laid my head. <br>
              Three days to my birthday I said, as the rain fell down to my makeshift bed. <br>
              Sure the stars came alight that night, and fixed my vision on a dead moonlight. <br>
              I told myself that you're stronger than this, that you won't get upset and it's you they'll miss. <br>
              Though I just couldn't help myself as the tears streamed down her broken face. <br>
              From the booze and the drugs and abuse, was my state laid bare under gold street light. <br>
              And she screamed "Take a look at yourself!", she shook me, I held her, she praid for my health. <br>
              I said I was sorry. But it was too late, as I woke she had left. <br>
              <br>
              Pre Chorus <br>

              About that time I realised, you gotta help yourself. <br>
              Stop feeling sorry for yourself. <br>
              So I rise, roll a cigarette, to greet my lips as my body aches. <br>
              Sure i'm low but I'm living, and I trick my mind just one last time. <br>
              All the thoughts in my head seemed to clear, as I bellowed at that demon that I no longer feared. <br>
              That I just don't need him, like he don't need me, this time when I left I was sure. <br>
              No you ain't wanted here no more, the locks you changed on our front door. <br>
              Let it all spew out. Your control. And your violence. Your obsession. You're on your own. <br>
              I said now, you're on your own. <br>
              <br>
              Pre Chorus <br>
              <br>
              Mid 8 <br>
              But now looking back, to the church and the multi story where I slept. <br>
              To the food that I stole off people's discarded plates at those pubs. <br>
              My ghost still haunts me. <br>
              It's not your fault. <br>
              It's not your fault. <br>
              It's not your fault. <br>
              It's not your fault. <br>
              But then again it still is. <br>
              And my mate Mike he went and took me in, <br>
              His family helped me out. <br>
              <br>
              I'll scour my soul
